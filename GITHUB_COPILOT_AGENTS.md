# GitHub Copilot Agents Guide

## What are GitHub Copilot Agents?

GitHub Copilot Agents are AI-powered assistants that help developers with various tasks throughout the software development lifecycle. They extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities beyond code completion to include:

- Code reviews
- Bug fixing
- Documentation generation
- Test creation
- Refactoring
- And much more!

## The Claude HQ Agent

The **Claude HQ Agent** is a high-quality AI agent powered by Anthropic's Claude AI model. It's particularly good at:

- Understanding complex codebases
- Providing detailed explanations
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Following best practices
- Working with modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and TypeScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Copilot Subscription**: You need an active GitHub Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
2. **Supported IDE**: 
   - Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot extension
   - JetBrains IDEs with GitHub Copilot plugin
   - Neovim with Copilot plugin

### Setting Up GitHub Copilot Agents

#### In Visual Studio Code

1. **Install GitHub Copilot Extension**
   ```
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot"
   - Click Install
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   ```

2. **Enable Copilot Chat**
   ```
   - Install "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension
   - Restart VS Code if needed
   ```

3. **Access Agents**
   ```
   - Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I)
   - Type `@` to see available agents
   - Select the agent you want to use
   ```

## ü§ñ Using the Claude HQ Agent

### Basic Usage

1. **Open Copilot Chat**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac)
   - Or click the chat icon in the sidebar

2. **Invoke the Agent**
   ```
   @workspace /explain what does this component do?
   ```

3. **Ask Questions**
   ```
   @workspace How can I optimize this React component?
   @workspace Write tests for this function
   @workspace Refactor this code to use TypeScript
   ```

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Code Explanation
```
@workspace Explain how the Globe component in app/page.tsx works
```

#### 2. Bug Fixing
```
@workspace Why is this component not rendering properly?
@workspace Fix the TypeScript errors in this file
```

#### 3. Code Generation
```
@workspace Create a new component for displaying user testimonials
@workspace Generate a form with validation using react-hook-form and zod
```

#### 4. Refactoring
```
@workspace Refactor this code to use modern React patterns
@workspace Convert this component to use TypeScript
```

#### 5. Documentation
```
@workspace Add JSDoc comments to this function
@workspace Write a README for this component
```

#### 6. Testing
```
@workspace Generate unit tests for this component
@workspace Create integration tests for this API route
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "Fix this code"
‚úÖ Good: "Fix the TypeScript error in the Header component where the onClick handler is missing proper types"

### 2. Provide Context
```
@workspace I'm working on the contact form in components/contact.tsx. 
I need to add email validation using zod schema. The form should:
- Validate email format
- Check for required fields
- Show error messages below each field
```

### 3. Use File References
```
@workspace Looking at app/page.tsx, how can I improve the performance 
of the Globe component?
```

### 4. Iterate and Refine
- Start with a broad question
- Ask follow-up questions to refine the solution
- Request explanations if something is unclear

### 5. Review Suggestions
- Always review the code suggested by the agent
- Test the changes before committing
- Ensure it follows your project's conventions

## üîç Advanced Features

### Workspace Context

The `@workspace` agent has access to your entire codebase and can:
- Search across all files
- Understand project structure
- Follow naming conventions
- Reference related code

Example:
```
@workspace How is the theme system implemented across this project?
```

### Multi-Turn Conversations

You can have extended conversations with the agent:

```
User: @workspace Create a new feature component
Agent: [Generates component]
User: Add TypeScript types
Agent: [Adds types]
User: Now add unit tests
Agent: [Generates tests]
```

### Code Actions

Right-click on code and select:
- "Copilot: Explain This"
- "Copilot: Fix This"
- "Copilot: Generate Tests"
- "Copilot: Generate Docs"

## üí° Tips for This Project

### Working with Next.js 15
```
@workspace Create a new server action for handling form submissions 
in the contact form, compatible with Next.js 15 App Router
```

### TypeScript Integration
```
@workspace Add proper TypeScript types to this component and ensure 
it follows the project's type conventions
```

### Styling with Tailwind
```
@workspace Style this component using Tailwind CSS v4 syntax, 
maintaining the project's design system
```

### shadcn/ui Components
```
@workspace Create a new dialog component using shadcn/ui that matches 
the existing component patterns in this project
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify GitHub Copilot subscription is active
3. Restart your IDE
4. Sign out and sign back into GitHub

### Poor Suggestions
1. Provide more context in your prompt
2. Reference specific files or functions
3. Break down complex requests into smaller steps
4. Specify the technologies/frameworks being used

### Performance Issues
1. Close unnecessary files
2. Reduce workspace size if very large
3. Use more specific agents (@terminal, @vscode instead of @workspace)
